          <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-gray-900 mx-5'>I was not much into Korean dramas earlier, actually I never liked any drama be it Indian or Korean. But the Hallyu star Song Zoong Ki starring in Descendents of the Sun made me curious of this Korean thing.
          The very reason I started watching Korean dramas is same for many because of the main leads’ attractiveness but later the focus shifted to story and acting.</h2>

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4 '>This will always remain one of my favorite K-drama because it was my first drama. Song-Song couple steals our heart. Everything in this drama is on the point. The OST, the acting, the chemistry between leads, the simple yet worthy of watching storyline,the cinematography, no stupid Love triangles and obviously it has Song Zoong Ki oppa what else do you need.

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>This I watched after a year of watching DOTS. Ji-Ji couple is so cute.Ji Chang Wook in his one of the finest works. Nam Ji Hyun too acted good. The storyline is good too. The number of episodes may try to distract you but give it a try. Also the villain may steal your heart.

          </p><p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>This was my third drama. I was already much into Korean culture and their difference with American culture. But this drama was so pro. I really liked the leads. The male lead was very cute. Their chemistry was so mature yet innocent, no stupid misunderstandings and the way male lead tries to cover up for female lead definitely melted my heart. It was so nature looking Chemistry that you would definitely fall for it. Also Dr. Kim is just so perfect and his acting is a bliss for Korean industry for sure.

          </p><p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>This drama is owned by Jeun Ji Hyun especially in its starting episodes. The character development of the main lead is prominent only in last episodes. The second lead syndrome will hit you hard. From this drama I became a permanent fan of Jeun Ji Hyun. This drama will make you go through every emotion of life, it will make you laugh and cry both. The chemistry between leads is no joke. Even though the drama is a bit old but still has capability to hold you till the end.

          </p><p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>I was not watching it because I was scared of getting disappointed. But believe me it is worth of all those praises. Each scene is worth of making wallpaper. The cinematography is of world level. Just the chemistry between main leads was not as much charming as of the second leads. Also past scenes may bore you due to repetition. Just if second leads would have got a little more screen. It would have been perfect. But still the dialogues, the acting is to the point. And OST is love.</p>

It was really good. The story was cool too. Jun Ji hyun once again will make you laugh a lot. And of course Lee Min Ho is an amazing actor. Be careful of Shin Won Ho he may steal your hearts.

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4 '>A romcom drama with twist of supernatural power. Park Bo Young is so cute in this drama. Park Hyun Sik is So handsome. But the second lead syndrome was very bad in this drama. This drama has a good amount of comedy to feed you with.

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>This drama had its own fan following due to Kim Samuel. Give it a try for Samuel,. The school life problems are dealt with the help of an app. Second lead syndrome in this will convince you that good girls never end with good boys they are more attracted towards bad boys of grey shaded characters.

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>Oh boy, this drama is so full of IU and I loved it. It is one of my favourite drama of all times. Man Woi’s character development is so relatable and not ideal like other drama’s female leads. This is also considered a copy of Goblin but except cinematography I found it better than Goblin. The past scenes are so intense that you will definitely end up crying. Wardrobe of IU are another reason to give it a watch. The Acting is very on the point and relatable and the best thing is female lead is full of flaws.

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>Reasons to watch this Cha Eun Woo, Cha Eun Woo, and Cha Eun Woo. Leading pair despite of age difference is very sizzling. Also the antagonist’s acting is worthy of appreciation. Acting too is good. And storyline enough attractive. What else do you want? The cruel reality of beauty standards of society is very well portrayed.

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>A cringy drama with my favourite Lee Min Ho and Kim Wo Bin. I don’t know why writers believed that what Min Ho is showing towards Shin Hye was Love. The second lead syndrome was one of the strongest in this drama. And it was disappointing that the female lead ended up with somebody who hurt her a lot and not with somebody who truly cared about her. Min Ho never asked for what she wants. He did what he wanted to do. That’s why I hate this drama. But still you can watch it for it’s wonderful list of actors in cast.

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>Did second lead ever felt so main lead.? This is a drama for which I can definitely say that writers must have smell weed while writing the final episode because it can never ever make sense. Ian gave up his 10 years old crush on Eunbyeol just because of a brief meeting with Eunbi, wow he was so touched and Eunbi only liked Ian even though he hurt her and couldn’t like Taeyong who did everything literally everything to make her happy. But Eunbyeol is a character which will steal your heart. Just that the writers would not have messed up the ending This drama would have become my favorite. I became fan of Kim So Hyun after this drama. Also Taeyong became a friend Everybody needs. Just does it makes sense that Taeyong and Eunbi got best pair award even when they didn’t end up together. This shows flaws in writing.

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4 '>Seriously do you need reasons? Obviously you need, being an EXO-L sometimes it feels why people can’t live with love them. Okie so I was introduced to K-Pop through BTS, I liked them very much and was most an Army but gotta listen to Ko Ko Bop MV of EXO and man I loved it. So I dug more into EXO and each and every song was so beautiful. The vocals, the lyrics, the choreography, the visuals everything of top class! Now please let’s not compare them with any other boy band on the basis of number of views on youtube or number of fans over the world because we know who would be the winner, but let’s talk as music lover. It’s completely my choice so I hope nobody should be affected. But EXO has its own charm.
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>After the release of ‘You can call me Monster’, I became sure of my favorite boy-band. My reason for starting to like them can be the Legendary moves of Kai or deep voice of Chanyeol or because of annoying yet cutie Baekhyun or awe of strong vocals of Chen or looks of Sehun or the very presence of Suho or cat eyed Xiumin or those Scary yet Aeygo looks from D. O. or innocent Lay, but now I love them FOR BEING EXO NO OTHER REASON!
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>What I like most about EXO that they stayed strong despite of all the problems in their way they stayed strong and firm. Because what they experienced in 2014 after that very few bands can comeback. Their group was on the verge of being disbanded few members left the group but Suho our saviour saved our reason to be happy our EXO!

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>EXO is one, combination of beautiful Vocals of Suho, Chen,Chanyeol, D. O.,magnificent dance of Kai, Lay and Sehun. Where else will you get a group where everyone is so unique, where everyone is a VISUAL!

excited because it was her first time doing village work….Ved was bored as
hell and just wanted to get himself out of that….Grandpa told them to
hurry up as another farm which is a bit far from here is also left to
collect fruits from….Arya did her share of work quickly and left with Grandpa
for next farm …Ved came to her running he left his work incomplete ,
that made Arya mad , she shouted you’re supposed to finish….. He teasingly
said I am to become actor in future how can i work under sun , I am
jealous you can work under sun without getting sunburns.
That made Arya so angry she instantly wanted to pull his hairs out…..
But she was conscious of her image in front of her grandpa as they met
after so long time, she didn’t wanted to ruin her image…..So all she did was
clenching her fist…..

          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>Scene :Home
Arya was lying on bed in her room , his brother on couch in the same room
Both of them were using their phones, room was a bit dim lighted…..Ved was
playing game with full volume on speakers, Arya shouted to lower it down..
Suddenly their mom came in wearing salwaar suit looking worried.
She said grandpa is admitted in hospital, he had a sudden heart attack.
That left both of them in shock….If this would have happened a few days
ago they wouldn’t have been so worried, but they just came back from
hometown making so many memories with grandpa which were fresh in their
minds .Mom told them to hurry they are going to hospital…..
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>Scene :Hospital entrance and alley
It was a large hospital, Arya and Ved went their together as other family already
came here ….They entered through glass door at entrance, after a walking
straight and then took a turn to go for stairs as grandpa was admitted in upper
floor. The alley after turn to stairs was a bit dark….Ved said to Arya “study
hard as it will be hard and become doctor as it will be hard to find
groom for you ” and then started laughing Arya shouted “will you shut up
or should I whack you down like always”. There were few people there
they looked towards them due to the noise they were producing…
A lean fair boy was also looking towards them…His eyes seemed dried…
His face was with no expressions at all…He caught the eye of Arya because
of his odd looks and eyes….and also because he seemed of same age as hers.
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>Scene: Hospital room near stairs which was used as store room
Arya woke up with a pain in her head. Her eyesight was blurry for a moment
It was a small room with dim lighting ..one corner of room stuffed with
cartoons in which medicines are delivered…
She woke up to see her brother Ved lying down on his stomach beside her..
Her heart thumped with the possibility of what she was praying to not be true.
She turned him around slowly, his eyes were wide open… A little shout came
from her mouth….She distanced from him….Then she went closer again,
his stomach was bleeding with a wound which was deep enough to kill…
Then she saw a pen without cap with lots of blood in its nib….Her head
started aching more, she saw flashes of memories of herselfn twisting
hands of her brother backwards and then taking out cap from another hand..
She started trembling….And just sat there for like 5 minutes…..Then she
saw a shadow of someone from the entrance gate coming closer as she was
looking down while in shock….She saw shadow going towards her brother
dragging him towards that pile of cardboard boxes…. she could see someone
dumping body inside cardboard and then he turned…IT WAS THE SAME PALE
STRANGE BOY….He came towards her and forwarded his hands towards her.
She was not in her sane mind , subconsciously she took his hand and standed
up…SO A MURDER HAPPENED AND APPARENTLY ARYA WAS THE CONVICT AND
THAT PALE GUY HER ACCOMPLICE…. and at that point Arya wanted to hide this
fact at all cost, but she also didn’t wanted her brother to die, she wanted
to believe in that small fraction of possibility that he is still alive….She ran
outside of room as soon as standed up…and shouted “help,someone is
injured here” She wanted to stay safe while protecting her brother ….But strangely
no one was listening to her….why was everyone taking me so lightly that’s
what she was thinking …she didn’t leave that dark alley…maybe because
she was scared enough to get caught…
Then she sat outside the room waiting for anyone to come in room and notice
him.Suddenly that pale guy reappeared in front of her and gave a look that
said YOUR BROTHER IS DEAD, she no longer found herself searching for
aid to cure my brother…..That look in his eyes was enough communication
between them…..He the said that he had taken care of all CCTV footages , At that
point she realised that she would have confessed to everyone about murdering
her own brother but since that pale boy came , she wanted to stay innocent,
she now had a hope that she can get out of all this mess…She was also blaming
herself for not feeling enough guilty but deep down she was happy because of
presence of that pale guy….NOBODY KNEW ABOUT MY BROTHER DYING TILL THEN…
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>Scene: Hospital hall where patients or gaurdians wait
A lage hall with seats for people to wait for their appointments…
well lighted in contrast with alley…..gives vibes of fear to protagonist
that truth can’t be hidden in such light for long time…
Grandpa was discharged , everyone was happy, mom, dad, family of my uncle
was also there…nobody noticed absence of my brother in all that chaos..
suddenly Arya remembered about the typewriter grandpa had in which he
used to write his daily journal….She used it while they were in hometown several
times, and she wrote about how much she hates her brother in that, and
how much she wants her to be dead…..Grandpa had brought that
typewriter in hospital too , for in case he wanted to write his will etc…
She ran towards stairs to go to grandpa’s alloted room.
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>Scene: Hospital room where Grandpa was admitted
A dim-litted room small sized room, with space only for one bed with a window..
Typewriter was right there, but that pale guy was already messing with it..
She instantly knew he is here for same purpose as her…Now this was the
first time she thought logically about the situation, who was this guy, why was
he helping her, did he knew us before this too, what will he get from hiding this
murder, how did he knew about typewriter…..But asking any of these
question might give him the hint that she was doubting his intentions..
and at that moment she didn’t wanted to anger him at all, he was all she could
see as wood piece to hang on while she is drowning….
          </p>
          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>
          Scene: Home
Everyone already returned , she stayed at hospital a bit late due to typewriter
It was already dark when she came back…..she didn’t felt that her home was same
as before….it seemed huge to her, as if home was accusing her for killing
the only son of home…..The gate was unusually huge…..It was pitch dark inside..
mom and dad were sleeping in hall, door made creaking sound while opening..
mom woke up due to that sound, she was wearing white night gown , her
hairs were open, her big magnificent eyes were visible to protagonist
even in pitch dark , mom sat on bed for few minutes looking straight in eyes
of Arya..
Arya felt stabbed….it felt like mom was smiling though she couldn’t see anything
it felt like mom was pitying her , she was accusing her at the same time
for killing her son… Arya’s consciousness seemed drowning, she just went
and slept to avoid this deep stare….but then Arya remembered that
YES SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HER BROTHER BUT SHE WOULD NEVER KILL HIM…
SHE NEVER HAD THAT PEN, THAT PALE GUY MUST HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH
THIS ALL…..she ran outside of home
</p>
<p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>
Scene: Hospital alley
She ran in the entrance and went straight to the alley before stairs…
contrastingly it was well lit for very first time, she could see every thing
clearly….that pale guy was standing there only just where she saw him for
the first time,….he smiled looking at her….she was out of breath cos of running..
that smile on that emotionless face gave her chills down her spine….
She shouted YOU MURDERER……he looked at her and said ” do you really not remember”
“Your brother is dead a long time before in accident” “You fought with him
the day he died so you couldn’t live with that unbearable guilt” “you
manipulated your brain to believe a story where you are the victim and he
is the wicked one” “that pen was the gift you gave him ever” “You are the
weak one” “How dare you to blame me” “YOU’RE THE REAL PATIENT OF HOSPITAL”
Arya was dumbfounded everything made sense now……She went straight to
room upstairs through stairs and slept in a hospital bed ….she went in that
room unconsciously as if she had came here many times…..First time tears rolled
down her cheeks in past 24 hours after her brother died…in no moment she was
asleep.
</p>
<p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>
Scene: Home
It was room of Arya , came the voice of her mom from a distant “Wake up beta”
room was cozy, unorganized, well lit…

Is it a loop, a bad dream, a hallucination ,a mental disorder, a crime scene,
or everyone is really hiding something from her….?
