          <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-gray-900'>I was not much into Korean dramas earlier, actually I never liked any drama be it Indian or Korean. But the Hallyu star Song Zoong Ki starring in Descendents of the Sun made me curious of this Korean thing.
          The very reason I started watching Korean dramas is same for many because of the main leads’ attractiveness but later the focus shifted to story and acting.</h2>
          <h2 className='text-justify text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-gray-900'> Descendents of the Sun:</h2>
          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4 '>This will always remain one of my favorite K-drama because it was my first drama. Song-Song couple steals our heart. Everything in this drama is on the point. The OST, the acting, the chemistry between leads, the simple yet worthy of watching storyline,the cinematography, no stupid Love triangles and obviously it has Song Zoong Ki oppa what else do you need.
          <h2 className='text-justify text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-gray-900'> The Suspicious Partner: </h2>
          <p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>This I watched after a year of watching DOTS. Ji-Ji couple is so cute.Ji Chang Wook in his one of the finest works. Nam Ji Hyun too acted good. The storyline is good too. The number of episodes may try to distract you but give it a try. Also the villain may steal your heart.
          <h2 className='text-justify text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-gray-900'> Dr. Romantic: </h2>
          </p><p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>This was my third drama. I was already much into Korean culture and their difference with American culture. But this drama was so pro. I really liked the leads. The male lead was very cute. Their chemistry was so mature yet innocent, no stupid misunderstandings and the way male lead tries to cover up for female lead definitely melted my heart. It was so nature looking Chemistry that you would definitely fall for it. Also Dr. Kim is just so perfect and his acting is a bliss for Korean industry for sure.
          <h2 className='text-justify text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-gray-900'> You, who came from Another Star: </h2>
          </p><p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>This drama is owned by Jeun Ji Hyun especially in its starting episodes. The character development of the main lead is prominent only in last episodes. The second lead syndrome will hit you hard. From this drama I became a permanent fan of Jeun Ji Hyun. This drama will make you go through every emotion of life, it will make you laugh and cry both. The chemistry between leads is no joke. Even though the drama is a bit old but still has capability to hold you till the end.
          <h2 className='text-justify text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-gray-900'> What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim:  </h2>                                                             
          </p><p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>This is definition of Rom-Com dramas. It has every cliche I should hate but I still love this drama. The leads are amazing. And believe me the expressions of Park Seo Joon are worth watching.The comic timing is everything!
          <h2 className='text-justify text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-gray-900'> Guardian The great and lonely God: </h2> 
          </p><p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>I was not watching it because I was scared of getting disappointed. But believe me it is worth of all those praises. Each scene is worth of making wallpaper. The cinematography is of world level. Just the chemistry between main leads was not as much charming as of the second leads. Also past scenes may bore you due to repetition. Just if second leads would have got a little more screen. It would have been perfect. But still the dialogues, the acting is to the point. And OST is love.</p>
          <h2 className='text-justify text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-gray-900'> The Legend of the Blue Sea: </h2> 
          </p><p className='text-justify mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4'>This is definition of Rom-Com dramas. It has every cliche I should hate but I still love this drama. The leads are amazing. And believe me the expressions of Park Seo Joon are worth watching.The comic timing is everythingI am saddened that this wonderful drama was overshadowed by Goblin. It was really good. The story was cool too. Jun Ji hyun once again will make you laugh a lot. And of course Lee Min Ho is an amazing actor. Be careful of Shin Won Ho he may steal your hearts.
